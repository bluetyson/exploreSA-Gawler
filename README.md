# exploreSA-Gawler

> Background: This github project is part of the exploreSA competition on [unearthed.solution](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/exploresa)  Here is [my original post](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/80/forum#/question/441d6535-6d37-4550-88b9-12bc0c0a5342) on exploreSA forum to explain what our team has done for the data cleaning part. For more information please visit the unearth website there is [detailed description page](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/exploresa)

### Description

**Drilling, surface sample and observations data: A dataset with features and labels**

The SARIG Data Package is an extract from the Geological Survey of South Australiaâ€™s (GSSA) geoscientific database SA Geodata. The data package includes a series of CSV files covering 4 parts:

*  Drill holes data, including the metadata of drill holes, and the geological, petrophysical, lithological data

* Field observation data, including general observation, lithological and geological structure data.

* Mineral deposits data, including location, lithology, mineralogy data

* Rock sample data, including biostratigraphy, geochronology and petrography analysis data

This dataset plays an important role in the whole data pool used for predicting the cores in Gawler area. Since the dataset includes the commodities information and the elements from the geochemistry analysis which suggest the occurrence of the minerals. In other words, the labels for the training dataset is defined. The attributes of these datasets can be cleaned as features in the following machine learning modelling.



### How to use

Step 1. Install Python 3.7

Step 2. Install Anaconda(optional)

Step 3. Download dataset: https://unearthed-exploresa.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Unearthed_5_SARIG_Data_Package.zip

The idea of this repo is to show people the cleaning data process we have done until now. There are still a lot of work to do. We will update it afterwards.
